## Kashiwara operators

- This script computes **a** Kashiwara operator in AnnFs given a polynomial (with isolated singularity at the origin).
- Kashiwara operators are defined in the analytic setting. For case of non-isolated singularities a (more complicated) should exist, which could be a future direction to explore.
